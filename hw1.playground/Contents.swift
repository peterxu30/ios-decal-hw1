//: ## Q1: Optionals
class Words {
    var wordA : String!
    var wordB : String!
    
    init (wordA: String?, wordB: String?) {
        self.wordA = wordA
        self.wordB = wordB
    }

//: ### Are the values passed in to the **init** function and those set to the instance
//: ### variables the same type? If not, why?


//: Yes, they are both optionals. The only difference being self.wordA and self.wordB will always be treated as if the optional was explicity unwrapped.


//: ## Q2: Variable Types and Function Types
    class func arePalindromes(words: [String]) -> Bool {
        let reversedWords = words.map() {String($0.characters.reverse())}
        var numElements = words.count
        
        for var i = 0; i < numElements; i++ {
            if words[i] != reversedWords[i] {
                return false
            }
        }
        return true
    }

//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.


//: We used let to create the variable i. i is a counter variable and will change as the loop iterates. However, as a static variable, reassignment of i beyond the original assignment will not be possible. In addition, the function will only return a boolean value if the if condition within the loop is satisfied. This does not cover all possible cases.
//    
// Additionally, the method must be a class method to be used by the class below.


//: ## Q3: More Functions and Object Initialization
    func isAnagram() -> Bool {
        var countLetters = [Character : Int]()
        var lenA = self.wordA.characters.count
        var lenB = self.wordB.characters.count
        
        if lenA != lenB {
            return false
        }
        
        var arrA = Array(self.wordA.characters)
        var arrB = Array(self.wordB.characters)
        
        for i in 0...lenA-1 {
            let letter = arrA[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] {
                countLetters[letter] = val + 1
            } else {
                countLetters[letter] = 1
            }
        }
        
        for i in 0...lenB-1 {
            let letter = arrB[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] {
                countLetters[letter] = val - 1
            } else {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        for (letter, count) in countLetters {
            if count != 0 {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        return true
    }
//: ### What is the problem with declaring **countLetters** as we do in **Line X**,
//: ### and then using it in **Line Y**? Fix it (by only changing **Line X**).
//: ### What else is wrong with this function? You may have to refer to (but **not**
//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.


//: countLetters is never initialized. Since it is created within the body of a function and not the body of the class, it cannot behave like an instance variable and wait for initialization.
//    
//  Instance variables wordA and wordB cannot be accessed from a class method. The method must be made an instance method. Also, we cannot return nil as the method output must be a bool type value.
